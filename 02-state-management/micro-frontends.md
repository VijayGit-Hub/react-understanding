# Micro-Frontends: State Management, Redux Toolkit, and Event Bus

Micro-frontend architectures require careful state management to ensure isolation, communication, and scalability. This section focuses on sharing state, using Redux Toolkit, and implementing event bus patterns in a function component world.

## Key Interview Questions

1. How do you share state between micro-frontends in a React ecosystem?
2. What is an event bus, and how does it differ from shared state containers?
3. What are the challenges of using Redux Toolkit in a micro-frontend architecture?
4. How do you ensure isolation and avoid state pollution between micro-frontends?
5. How do you implement cross-app communication using an event bus?
6. What are the best practices for error handling and security in shared state scenarios?
